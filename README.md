# Password Generator
https://aijus2022.github.io/Password-generator/

A simple web application that generates random passwords based on user criteria.


## Overview

This web app allows users to generate a random password by specifying the length and character types (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters). The generated password is then displayed using an alert.

## Instructions

1. Open the HTML file (https://github.com/Aijus2022/Password-generator/blob/main/index.html) in a web browser.
2. Enter the desired password length (between 8 and 128 characters) in the input field.
3. Check the character types you want to include in the password (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters).
4. Click the "Generate Password" button.
5. If valid criteria are provided, an alert will display the generated password.

## Files

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: A simple CSS styling for the user input boxes and confirmation boxes. 
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic for password generation.

## How it Works

- The app uses prompts and confirms to gather user input for password length and character types.
- It validates the input and ensures at least one character type is selected.
- Based on the user's choices, it constructs a character set and generates a random password.
- The generated password is displayed using an alert.

## Customize

Feel free to customize the app, add more features, or enhance the user interface based on your preferences. The provided code is a starting point, and you can build upon it to suit your needs.
